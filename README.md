## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). This project demonstrates how to fine-tune these models for specific text classification tasks, improving their performance on domain-specific data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Fine-tuning of various LLMs
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of classification results

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-classification-finetuning.git
cd llm-classification-finetuning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset for training.
   ```bash
   python prepare_data.py
   ```

2. **Fine-tuning Models**: Fine-tune the LLMs on your dataset.
   ```bash
   python finetune_model.py --model_name bert-base-uncased
   ```

3. **Evaluating Models**: Evaluate the fine-tuned models.
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py --model_name bert-base-uncased
   ```

## Models

The following models are fine-tuned in this project:

- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)
- RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Visualizations of the classification results are provided to compare the models.
